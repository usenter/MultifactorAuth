# Multi-User Login Script for MultifactorAuth Server
# Reads encrypted_users.txt and attempts to log in with users simultaneously
# 
# IMPORTANT: This script addresses the "auth success timeout" issue where:
# - Server successfully authenticates clients
# - Clients receive auth success message
# - But expect script's 'interact' command fails in background mode
# - Script incorrectly reports timeout failures
# 
# Solution: Use proper background monitoring instead of 'interact'
